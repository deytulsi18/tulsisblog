The term ‚ÄúOcean Dumping‚Äù refers to the dumping of waste materials, litter, plastics, and all other organic and inorganic waste products into the water of the ocean directly. This unethical and unhealthy practice leads to very harmful consequences of Water Pollution.<br><br>

Thus, in other words, it can be said that Ocean Dumping is a practice for water pollution in the ocean. This is a matter of great concern as it affects the biodiversity in the ocean water bodies. This concern is nowadays gaining a lot of attention from all the individuals and the countries as a whole as it affects the world. If proper steps of prevention and remedies are not taken in time, it may lead to the extinction of certain species and the destruction of biodiversity.<br><br>

With the expansion of irrigation and transportation facilities, development has jumped in many industries and countries. However, the simultaneous hazards are also resulting out of it. The development at the cost of nature has to present ill impacts and future ill impacts. The oceans are also treated as a significant way of transportation of people and goods from one part of the world to another. By exposure to the global oceans, humans are dumping all the waste materials, both organic and inorganic, into the ocean and polluting them.<br><br>

Even when the ships or submarines crash or meet accidents, they immerse in the water, and all the constituents, metals, and all other things get drowned in the water. Since most of the materials are non-biodegradable, they take a lot of time, sometimes, even decades to decompose. This way, they hamper the ecosystem under the oceans.<br><br>

The oil spillage that results from ships and the ocean mining done to extract coal, petroleum, and all other minerals under the sea is in a significant way bringing harmful effects to the ocean‚Äôs environment. Not only this, many factories and industries dump all the toxic chemical wastes generated in due process to the ocean water to get rid of them.<br><br>

We should be sensitive to understand that the ocean covers almost three-forth of the earth and gives home to many aquatic organisms, both flora and fauna. Also, it is a food source for animals. When such reckless ocean dumping is done, the toxic materials and other waste materials pollute the ocean‚Äôs environment. They mix with the aquatic animals‚Äô food, when they consume it, it affects their health, it may lead to their death and eventual extinction. Moreover, when people consume seafood, they also consume all the toxins and waste materials. This results in adverse health effects on humans. Thus, it is high time that all these ocean dumpings must be strictly stopped, and other measures must be taken to make the ocean biodiversity healthy.<br><br>

Ocean Dumping is a kind of water pollution in which the ocean water gets infected or contaminated when the toxic materials and other harmful wastes from industries and ships are thrown away or unloaded into it. Such pollution not only affects marine life, aquatic biodiversity of the vast sea; they also are a threat to the entire globe in many direct and indirect ways. The growth of transportation, irrigation, and industrialization has brought serious environmental issues and threats and growth and progress.<br><br>

Domestic sewage, marine mining, spilling of oil and other toxic materials, dumping of wastes by industries are a significant cause of ocean Dumping. The aquatic animals, both flora and fauna, when they come in contact with such hazardous materials and consume it, block their digestive and respiratory systems, due to which they die. If proper recourse is not taken, it will lead to a loss of biodiversity and the end of lives on the earth.
